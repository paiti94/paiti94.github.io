<h1> The future of Python and AI </h1> I have recently been doing python coding and I am really enjoying it. I wanted to talk about what I think the future of Python is and what it has in store for the future. I would like to say that if you are interested in coding or AI it is a great time to get into it as it is only going to get bigger in the future.<br />
     Python is a great choice for AI because it is a great programming language to use for it. Python is great for AI because it is easy to use, versatile and easy to learn, it is also more accessible and user friendly than some other languages. This is why Python is a great choice for AI and why it is used by a lot of the big players in the industry like Google and Facebook.<br />
     The future of Python is also bright as there are a lot of new developments that will be coming out. One of the main things that I have noticed is that Python is becoming increasingly popular. It has already surpassed C++ in popularity and is now the most popular language of choice. This is only going to increase in the future as more people become interested in AI and Python. This is a great thing for Python as it is becoming more accessible and user friendly which is good for beginners.<br />
